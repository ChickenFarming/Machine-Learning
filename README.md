<h3 align="center">Machine Learning Project - Chicken disease model</h3>
	<p align="left">


Introducing we from the Machine Learning team have the responsibility to create machine learning models so they can be deployed into applications
We created a model for one of our application main features is *Disease Scanning*
And requires appropriate and accurate machine learning models

We created a model from available open source data, here is a link to the data :
- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allandclive/chicken-disease-1)
- [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4628934#.YtDNzOxBy1u)


Our data consists of 4 classes :
- Healthy (Non Disease)
- Cocci (Disease)
- NCD (Disease)
- Salmonela (Disease)

We will create code for the model which will be converted into model.h5 and model.tflite, and will be deployed into the mobile app
We only choose one model that has the best accuracy in our team, so that our application has good performance
We have each branch with different models for each person, and here is detailed information :
1. Wahyu Luna Wijaya
   - model : transfer learning
   - type TL : Mobilenet V2
   - Accuracy : 94%
2. Nur Afika
   - model : transfer learning
   - type TL : Mobilenet V3 Small
   - Accuracy : 96%
3. Sri Rahayu Yusri
   - model : Normal
   - Accuracy : 95%

<h5 align="left">*And the model we chose, with the best accuracy is Nur Afika with the highest accuracy of 96%*</h5>
